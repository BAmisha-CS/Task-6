"Summarize how password complexity affects security"
Password complexity is a critical factor in protecting digital accounts and sensitive information from unauthorized access. The complexity of a password refers to the variety and unpredictability of characters it contains. This includes the use of:
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Numbers (0-9)
Special symbols (e.g., !, @, #, $)
Additionally, password length plays a vital role; longer passwords are inherently more secure than shorter ones.

"Why Complexity Matters"
The more complex a password, the larger the pool of possible combinations an attacker must try when attempting to guess or crack it. For example, a password with only lowercase letters and a length of 6 characters has 26^6 possible combinations (around 308 million). But adding uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols, as well as increasing length, exponentially increases the number of possible combinations, making brute force and dictionary attacks far less effective.

"Benefits of Complex Passwords
- Resilience to Brute Force Attacks: Complex passwords increase the time and computational power required to guess passwords through exhaustive trial.
- Resistance to Dictionary Attacks: Avoiding common words and predictable patterns prevents attackers from quickly finding matches using word lists.
- Protection Against Credential Stuffing: Unique complex passwords reduce the impact of data breaches by preventing password reuse across accounts.

"Best Practices"
- Use a mix of character types: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Aim for passwords that are at least 12 characters long.
- Avoid common words, predictable patterns, and repeated characters.
- Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords.

"Conclusion"
Increasing password complexity is one of the simplest and most effective steps users can take to strengthen security. Complex, unique passwords significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and help safeguard personal and organizational data.
