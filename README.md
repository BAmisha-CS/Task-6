# Task-6
Create and Evaluate a Strong Password Using Online Strength Checkers

This repository documents the process and results of evaluating password strength using a free online tool, [PasswordMeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com).

This file, which explains what was learned during the task.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To understand what makes a password strong by:
1. Creating multiple passwords with different complexity levels
2. Testing each password on an online strength checker
3. Analyzing the feedback to identify best practices
4. Documenting visual results using screenshots

ðŸ§ª Testing Method
Passwords were created using different combinations of:
- Uppercase and lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special characters
- Different lengths

Each password was entered into **PasswordMeter.com**, and screenshots were taken to capture:
- The password entered
- Strength percentage score
- Feedback on password characteristics

ðŸ“Š Password Examples & Observations

| Password        | Complexity Level | Score (Approx.) | Notes                                |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `password`      | Simple           | ~25%             | Common and weak                      |
| `Password1`     | Medium           | ~45%             | Better, but still guessable          |
| `P@ssw0rd123!`  | Strong           | ~75%             | Good mix of types, but still common  |
| `G#9vLz!e72nR`  | Very Strong      | ~90%+            | Long, complex, and hard to guess     

âœ… Tips Learned
- Longer passwords (12+ characters) are significantly stronger
- Mixing character types improves security
- Avoid common patterns and dictionary words
- Randomness is key to password strength
- Password managers are useful for storing complex passwords

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This task provided hands-on understanding of how passwords are evaluated and how to strengthen them effectively. Screenshots visually demonstrate how small changes in complexity can greatly impact password strength.
