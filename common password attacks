Research common password attacks

1. Brute Force Attack
How it works: The attacker tries every possible password combination until finding the right one. For example, if a password is 4 characters long using only lowercase letters (a-z), there are 26⁴ = 456,976 combinations.
As password length and character variety increase, the number of combinations grows exponentially, making brute force infeasible.

Example: Password: abc (very weak)
Brute force can try aaa, aab, aac... until it reaches abc.

Defense: Use long passwords (12+ characters) with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols to increase complexity and time needed to brute force.

2. Dictionary Attack
How it works: Instead of trying all combinations, the attacker uses a list of common passwords, words, or phrases—like password, 123456, qwerty, or even names from the dictionary.
This is much faster than brute force because many people use predictable or simple passwords.

Example : Attacker runs through the list: password, letmein, football, monkey, dragon, etc., until a match is found.

Defense: Avoid using dictionary words or common passwords.
Use unpredictable combinations and symbols. For example, instead of football, use something like F00tB@11!2025.

3. Credential Stuffing
How it works: Attackers use username/password combinations leaked from one website to try to log in to other services, relying on users reusing passwords.

Example: If your email and password are leaked from a social media site, attackers might try the same pair on your bank account or email provider.

Defense: Use unique passwords for every account.
Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords.
Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an extra layer of security.

4. Phishing
How it works: Attackers create fake websites or send emails pretending to be trustworthy sources (like your bank or employer) to trick you into entering your credentials.

Example: You receive an email that looks like it's from your bank, asking you to click a link and log in. The link goes to a fake site capturing your password.

Defense: Always check URLs carefully before entering credentials.
Avoid clicking suspicious links or attachments.
Use browser phishing filters and security software.

5. Keylogging
How it works: Malware installed on your device records every keystroke, capturing passwords and other sensitive information.

Example: A user unknowingly downloads software that logs keystrokes and sends captured data to an attacker.

Defense: Use reputable antivirus and anti-malware programs. 
Keep your operating system and software updated.
Avoid downloading files or apps from untrusted sources.

6. Rainbow Table Attack
How it works: When passwords are stored as hashes, attackers use precomputed tables (rainbow tables) of common password hashes to reverse the hash and discover the original password quickly.

Example: The hash for password123 is looked up in the rainbow table, revealing the original password instantly.

Defense: Websites and apps should use strong, salted hashing algorithms (like bcrypt, Argon2) to make rainbow table attacks ineffective.
As a user, this is why trusting reputable services and not reusing passwords is critical.
